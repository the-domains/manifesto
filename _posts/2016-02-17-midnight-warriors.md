To all the midnight warriors, the superhero dads, up all through the night soothing sick little babies... carry on!

When your eyes are weary and your head aches... keep it up!

For every explosive diaper changed and for holding your daughter's hair back as she heaves into the toilet... it matters!

With every unseen load of laundry, every extra cup of coffee downed, and for every hour of sleep your efforts afford your tired wife... you are not alone!

You play an integral role in your family.  Never forget that your strength is what they lean on when they are weak and scared. So be strong and lead on!
