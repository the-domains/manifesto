Manhood is not evenings in front of the TV.  It's 4am with a teething baby.

Manhood is not evenings in front of the TV.  It's 4am with a teething baby.

Strength is not pumping iron in the gym.  It's a patient reply to your wife's questions.

It's time to redefine manhood.  It's time for truth to be spoken and freemen to free men.
