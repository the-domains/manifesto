# Be Bold.  Be Courageous.

Is anything really holding you back?

Fear? What's that?! It's a figment of your imagination.  It's a whisper from a dead man -- it means nothing.

Go out there and take a risk. Playing it safe? It's already been done.  No one wants it.  You don't want it.

You want freedom! You want life! You want to put it all out on the line and find that there's more out there than comfort and complacency.

So don't hold back.  Look fear in the face and call it what it is. Nothing.

Be bold.  Be courageous.  You have one life on earth to live.  So make it count.
