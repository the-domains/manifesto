What does rest look like for the warrior heart of a man?

It's probably not sleeping in while your wife watches the kids or frequent nights out with the guys; though everyone needs some of those from time to time.

Realistically, it's probably a few minutes alone after the kids go down, a moment of inner reflection or quiet morning before the family wakes.

We all need rest and we all do it differently. Seek solitude. But avoid sloth. A warrior is never far from his sword.
