# Calling all Men

## Manhood is not defined by the stature of your frame or the status of your 401k. It's the surrender of your heart to the ever-present call of Jesus.

Your obedience to the call of Christ and stewardship of the responsibilities entrusted to you is the barometer of your masculinity.

The "state of our union" address your wife would give and your child knowing that "dad knows my heart" is a testimony to your legacy, or lack thereof.

Victory is knowing who you are, who your God is and the powerful authority that has been given to you as a son of the King and co-heir with Christ.

Apathy is an embarrassment and disengagement is a shame. Undying dedication to righteousness, health and obedience is to be praised.

You are not a victim of your reality.  You are the captain of your ship. Take a stand and stand together, for there is hope and beauty to be revealed.

Work as unto the Lord.  Live as if you had nothing to lose. Love as if everything was at stake. Because it is.  Your presence matters.

The prayers of a righteous man are powerful and effective, so get on your knees and be humbled and encouraged by the King of all Kings.

Do not advocate the role that you have been given, but take hold of the promise of new and abundant life. Join the ranks of your fellow warriors.
