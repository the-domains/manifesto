Manhood is not evenings in front of the TV.  It's 4am with a teething baby.

Strength is not pumping iron in the gym.  It's a patient reply to your wife's questions.

Love is not a sensual night or your dream car.  It's waking up hours before your family so you can pray for them.

It's time to redefine manhood.  It's time for truth to be spoken and freemen to free men.
