# The Importance of Being Wrong

I hate being wrong. I mean, I'm the quintessential Type-A perfectionist. Don't believe me? As a kid, I used to fold my dirty laundry before laying it in the hamper.

I've come a long way since then, but when I'm wrong, it still sucks.

But I love being wrong. You know why? Because it's, by far, the best way to humble me and reveal my flaws -- and usually, it's right out in front of everyone else to see it.

The best part about being wrong is when I try to defend it; especially to my wife.  Because when I do this, it makes my error so much more obvious and exposes my need for grace, growth and forgiveness.

There are no cliche answers or glib catch phrases to help in this department. It's cold, hard facts. And when my wrongness puts it's neck out there far enough to offend or hurt someone, it serves me right to receive a swift cuff on the head.

So, here's a note to self: you're going to be wrong. You're not going to like it. But if you're willing to surrender your own ego, fess up to the fault and seek forgiveness, you'll find that life puts you right back where you belong: humbly and thankfully in the sweet hands of grace.
